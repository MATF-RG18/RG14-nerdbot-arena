Nerdbot Arena

So you have decided to play my game... Is your internet down?
Anyway the rules are simple but if you lose the duel you lose your soul... 

The game is meant to be played by two people at the same time, the player that has bigger hands plays as Hammer-bot-3000 and the other one gets Anunaki. 

HB3 controls:

- press W A S D for movement
- press T to teleport - you can only teleport in the four basic directions anything else will end in failure, also you cannot teleport through the Arena walls
- press SPACE to summon a giant hammer and smack your opponent
- press F to throw your Hammer forward it also deals damage on the way back

Anunaki controls:

- press I J K L for movement
- press U to LASER your opponent
- press O to summon two mirror images of yourself to confuse your opponent
- press P to fire your energy orbs they detonate upon impact with the ground

Well thats all you need to know, you both start with 10 HP(Harry Potters) the first one that gets to 0 HP loses.
